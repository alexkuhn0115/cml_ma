### TwoSample MR Package Example

Taken from: https://mrcieu.github.io/TwoSampleMR/articles/introduction.html

```{r}
# Main package
library(TwoSampleMR)

# List avalailable GWASs
ao <- available_outcomes()

# Get instruments 
exposure_dat <- extract_instruments("ieu-a-2")

# Get effects of instruments on outcome 
outcome_dat <- extract_outcome_data(snps=exposure_dat$SNP, outcomes = "ieu-a-7")

# Harmonize the exposure and outcome data
dat <- harmonise_data(exposure_dat, outcome_dat)

# Perform MR
res <- mr(dat)
```

### Obtaining Data for MRcML paper

Following instructions from Section S4.1 in Supplementary materials for MRcML paper to obtain the data used. The following is example code given where fasting proinsulin is the exposure and age at smoking is the outcome. 

```{r}
library(TwoSampleMR)

# ID of Fasting Proinsulin as exposure, ID of Age at Smoking as outcome 
exp_id <- "ebi-a-GCST001212"
out_id <- "ieu-a-964"

# Extract IVs for exposure
exposure_dat <- extract_instruments(exp_id)

# LD-clumping of extracted IVs
exposure_dat <- clump_data(exposure_dat)

# Extract summary statistics of outcome, do not use proxy
outcome_dat <- extract_outcome_data(exposure_dat$SNP, out_id, proxies = 0)

# Harmonize data: correct strand for non-palindromic SNPs, drop all palindromic SNPs
dat <- harmonise_data(exposure_dat, outcome_dat, action = 3)
final_dat <- dat[dat$mr_keep,]

# Get final estimates and standard errors for exposure and outcome
b_exp <- final_dat$beta.exposure
b_out <- final_dat$beta.outcome
se_exp <- final_dat$se.exposure
se_out <- final_dat$se.outcome
```

### Using MRcML method

The MRcML package includes code in order to run the Mendelian randomization with constrained maximum likelihood (MRcML) methods. 

Here we follow the example here: https://github.com/xue-hr/MRcML for how to use the MRcML method using the given package. This example shows how to apply MRcML methods to make inference about the causal effect from **Fast Glucose (FG)** to **Type-2 Diabetes (T2D)**. 

```{r}
library(MRcML)
summary(T2D_FG) # Data included in package for sake of example
```
The example data `T2D_FG` is a list which contains estimated effect sizes and standard errors of 17 SNPs on T2D and FG. Next we perform the main function with sample size of FG which is 46186, and using 100 random start points. We set the random seed `random_seed = 1` to make sure results are replicable. 

```{r}
cML_result = mr_cML(T2D_FG$b_exp,
                    T2D_FG$b_out, 
                    T2D_FG$se_exp,
                    T2D_FG$se_out,
                    n = 46186,
                    random_start = 100, 
                    random_seed = 1)
```
We get a warning message from the function `cML_estimate_random()`. The reason is: here we use 100 random starting points to minimize the non-convex loss function, some of them may not converge to a local minimum and result in Fisher Information matrices that are not positive definite. It is not likely affecting the optimization result, since in the end we only use the start point gives the minimum loss and discard all other start points including those that do not converge.

Now lets take a look at the results:
```{r}
cML_result
```

The BIC selected model gives us indices of invalid IVs: 8, 12, 13, 15, and 17. The scatterplot below (image right now, change to code later) shows the invalid IVs marked in blue:
